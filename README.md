This Python code generates a maze and provides a simple console-based interface for the user to interact with the generated maze.

Here's an overview and the features of the code:

1)Maze Generation:

-->The mazeCreate function generates an n x n maze, where n is provided by the user.

-->The start and end points are marked with "S" (green) and "E" (green), respectively.

-->Random walls are placed in the maze, represented by a full block (red).

2)Maze Display:

-->The printMaze function is responsible for displaying the maze. It uses colorama for console text coloring.

-->Walls are displayed in red, open spaces in blue, the start and end points in green, and the path in green.

3)Path Finding Algorithm:

-->The maze solving is implemented using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

-->The path_finding function finds the shortest path from the start to the end using BFS and marks the path with circles (green).

-->If a path is found, the maze with the marked path is displayed. Otherwise, a message is printed stating that no path exists.

4)User Interaction:

-->The user is prompted to input the size of the maze initially and is presented with a menu for subsequent actions.

-->The user can choose to print the path, generate a new maze, or exit the program.

-->The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

5)Error Handling:

-->The code includes basic error handling to ensure that the user enters valid choices.

6)Code Organization:

-->The code is organized into functions for better readability and modularity.

-->The use of colorama makes the console output visually appealing.

7)Reusability:

-->he code allows the user to generate a new maze, providing flexibility for different scenarios.

8)Randomization:

-->The placement of random walls adds variety to each generated maze.

It's a simple yet engaging console-based maze generation and solving program that allows users to interact with the generated mazes. The use of colorama enhances the visual representation of the maze and its components.
